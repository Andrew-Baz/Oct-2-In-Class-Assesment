Repo for practicing all things git 


Hello, this is my attempt to complete the in-class assessment (I also spelled assessment wrong in the title of this repo when I copied it but please ignore that.)

This is my second commit, performed using the browser version of git.

This is my third commit, performed using branch1 on git bash.
